- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jonpaaa
- I'm learning to code cause I'm trying to make a program and I don't know any coders who aren't already busy who can help me full time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, HTML/CSS, C#, Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a web based application for transport and logistics planning
- 📫 How to reach me (Idk if you can message on Github)
